#### I want you to give me list of plugins that I should have added and that i'm missing out  

I notice that you haven't shared the contents of your plugin configuration files with me yet. To provide specific recommendations, I'll need to see what plugins you currently have. Could you please add the contents of:

1. `lua/user/plugins/init.lua` 
2. `lazy-lock.json` (if you have it)

This will help me see what plugins you're already using and suggest valuable additions that you might be missing. Please add these files to the chat and I'll provide a detailed list of recommended plugins with explanations for why each would be useful.

Based on your current plugin setup, here are some valuable plugins you might want to consider adding:

1. **Comment.nvim** - Better commenting capabilities
2. **mini.animate** - Smooth scrolling and cursor animations
3. **trouble.nvim** - Better error/warning/diagnostics display
4. **todo-comments.nvim** - Highlight and search TODO comments
5. **oil.nvim** - File explorer that feels like vim
6. **harpoon** - Quick file navigation between your most used files
7. **nvim-spectre** - Search and replace across multiple files
8. **persistence.nvim** - Session management
9. **mini.indentscope** - Visual indent guides
10. **conform.nvim** - Code formatting

Here's how to add these plugins to your configuration:

lua/user/plugins/init.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	{
		"kylechui/nvim-surround",
		version = "*", -- Use for stability; omit to use `main` branch for the latest features
		event = "VeryLazy",
		config = function()
			require("nvim-surround").setup({
			})
		end,
	},
})

	{
		"kylechui/nvim-surround",
		version = "*", -- Use for stability; omit to use `main` branch for the latest features
		event = "VeryLazy",
		config = function()
			require("nvim-surround").setup({
			})
		end,
	},
	{
		"numToStr/Comment.nvim",
		opts = {},
		lazy = false,
	},
	{
		"echasnovski/mini.animate",
		event = "VeryLazy",
		opts = {},
	},
	{
		"folke/trouble.nvim",
		dependencies = { "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" },
		opts = {},
	},
	{
		"folke/todo-comments.nvim",
		dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
		opts = {},
	},
	{
		"stevearc/oil.nvim",
		opts = {},
		dependencies = { "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" },
	},
	{
		"ThePrimeagen/harpoon",
		branch = "harpoon2",
		dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
	},
	{
		"nvim-pack/nvim-spectre",
		dependencies = {
			"nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
		},
	},
	{
		"folke/persistence.nvim",
		event = "BufReadPre",
		opts = {},
	},
	{
		"echasnovski/mini.indentscope",
		version = false,
		opts = {},
	},
	{
		"stevearc/conform.nvim",
		opts = {},
	},
})
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After applying these changes, run:
```bash
:Lazy sync
```

These plugins will enhance your Neovim experience with:
- Better code commenting
- Smooth animations
- Enhanced error navigation
- TODO comment management
- Improved file navigation
- Multi-file search and replace
- Session management
- Better indent visualization
- Code formatting

Would you like me to provide specific configuration details for any of these plugins?
